# NMIS Hackathon - Understanding Urban Climate through Digital Twins and IoT Devices

## Data
Data was gathered and combined from the Indian Weather Repositary.
The distributions of environmental parameters were fitted empirically, to allow data to be drawn and simulated for larger scale data analysis.

This data was then adapted to simulate a theoretical geospatial dataset of city-centre Glasgow, with effects of distances to key urban features such as green spaces, train stations, roads and rivers approximated via basic linear functions. 

## Front-end
This data was then combined with google maps data, to allow users to conduct basic environmental monitoring and geospatial contour analysis via the front end website developed.
